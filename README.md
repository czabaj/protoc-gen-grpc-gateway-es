# protoc-gen-grpc-gateway-es

Generate TypeScript client for gRPC API exposed via grpc-gateway. Powered by [protobuf-es framework](https://github.com/bufbuild/protobuf-es) and [bun toolchain](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun).

## Philosophy

The plugin walks over the proto files and converts protobuf messages to TypeScipt types and protobuf RPC to RPC JavaScript classes. The RPC classes are exported as `ServiceName_MethodName` and have following signature

```TypeScript
class RPC<RequestMessage, ResponseMessage> = {
  // HTTP method of the RPC as described by the google.api.http option
  readonly method: `DELETE` | `GET` | `PATCH` | `POST` | `PUT`;
  // URL path of the RPC as described by the google.api.http option
  readonly path: string;
  // Optional: the path to body in RequestMessage, if specified by the google.api.http option
  readonly bodyKey?: string;
  /**
   * Creates a JavaScript Request object which can be used directly with fetch API. If you are using other HTTP client,
   * you can read the request properties from the Request object.
   * @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request
   * @param config the request configuration for the RPC
   * @param params the request message for the RPC as defined in the proto file
   */
  createRequest: (c: RequestConfig) => (p: RequestMessage) => Request;
  /**
   * Simple identity function that just types the input as ResponseMessage.
   * Usefull for TypeScript code to assing a type to the response.
   */
  responseTypeId: (r: any) => ResponseMessage;
};
```

## Usage

The usage has two phases, first you need to generate the {Java,Type}Script files and then use them in your app.

### Generate {Java,Type}Script files

The package outputs an executable, which contains fixed version of `bun` runtime and all the needed source files. The executable is currently little overweight (~60MB), but it is a [known issue of `bun`](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/4453), hopefully they will fix this soon ü§û.

The executable is standard `protoc` plugin so you can use it with any `protoc` based tool, but the `buf generate` is hightly recommended since it takes the burden of resolving proto dependencies from your shoulders. If you need some intro to `buf generate` there is a [tutorial on buf website](https://buf.build/docs/generate/tutorial).

To run this plugin copy the executable to your codebase and configure the buf to use it in your `buf.yaml` file, for example

```yaml
version: v1
managed:
  enabled: true
  go_package_prefix:
    default: example/package/prefix
    except:
      - buf.build/googleapis/googleapis
      - buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway
plugins:
  - name: es
    opt: target=ts
    out: gen/es
    path: ./path/to/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway-es
```

You need to change:

- `managed.go_package_prefix.default` to your package prefix,
- `plugins[0].out` to the output directory of your choice,
- `plugins[0].path` to the path of the `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway-es` executable.

Then run `buf generate` (assuming you have properly installed and configured the `buf`) and it will generate the TypeScript files for you.

If you want to generate JavaScript instead, just pass change the plugin option `opt: target=js`.

The list of all plugin options is [here](https://github.com/bufbuild/protobuf-es/tree/5893ec6efb7111d7dbc263aeeb75d693426cacdd/packages/protoc-gen-es#plugin-options).

#### Note on formatting

To simplify the development, this plugin is not concerned with pretty printed output. The generated files are readable, but if your eyes are bleeding, use your favorite formatter after the files generation, e.g.

```sh
npx prettier --write gen/es/
```

### Usage in apps code

The generated files relies on some browser API, i.e. it is anticipated you will use it in the browser only, usage in Node.js is not tested, but in theory should work.

The generated files contains all the the protobuf messages as TypeScript types, all the protobuf enums as TypeScript enums and protobuf methods are converted to `RPC` JavaScript classes. There is also a top-level `runtime.ts` file which contains the constructor of `RPC` class and a few helper TypeScript types and functions.

The typical usage with `fetch` might look like this.

```TypeScript
import { SomeService_SomeMethod, type SomeMethodRequest } from "./gen/es/example/package/prefix/some_service_pb.ts";
import { type RequestConfig } from "./gen/es/runtime.ts"

const getBearerToken = () => {
  // your getter for bearer token in you app
  return `XYZ`;
}

const requestConfig: RequestConfig = {
  basePath: "https://example.test/api/v1",
  bearerToken: getBearerToken
};

const someMethodRequest: SomeMethodRequest = {
  flip: "flop",
}

// this is not required, but let's say we want to be able to abort the request
const abortController = new AbortController();

const serviceMethodCall = fetch(SomeService_SomeMethod.getRequest(config)(variables), { signal: abortController.signal }).then(response => {
  if (response.ok) {
    // type the response with the `responseTypeId` identity function, only needed in TypeScript
    return response.json().then(SomeService_SomeMethod.responseTypeId)
  }
  // reject the non-succesfull (non 2xx status code) response or do other things in your app
  return Promise.reject(response)
})
```

You should create a wrapper function around the `RPC` class since the logic will be probably the same for all RPCs. We don't provide this wrapper since it is app specific, but it might look something like this.

```TypeScript
import { SomeService_SomeMethod } from "./gen/es/example/package/prefix/some_service_pb.ts";
import { type RPC, type RequestConfig } from "./gen/es/runtime.ts"

// this is usually constant for all RPC's
const requestConfig: RequestConfig = {
  basePath: "https://example.test/api/v1",
  bearerToken: getBearerToken
};

// The types generic types `RequestMessage` and `ResponseMessage` are inferred from the `RPC` passed as an argument
const fetchWrapRPC = <RequestMessage, ResponseMessage>(
  rpc: RPC<RequestMessage, ResponseMessage>
) => {
  return (
    variables: RequestMessage,
    { signal }: { signal?: AbortSignal } = {}
  ) => {
    return fetch(rpc.createRequest(requestConfig)(variables), {
      signal,
    }).then((response) => {
      if (response.ok) {
        return response.json().then(rpc.responseTypeId);
      }
      return Promise.reject(response);
    });
  };
};

// wrap our RPC imported from the generated file
const someServiceSomeMethodAsyncFunction = fetchWrapRPC(SomeService_SomeMethod)

const abortController = new AbortController();
const response = await someServiceSomeMethodAsyncFunction({ flip: "flop" }, { signal: abortController.signal })
```

#### Usage caveats

1. The generated TypeScript files imports other TypeScript files with `.js` extension, [this can be changed in the plugin configuration](https://github.com/bufbuild/protobuf-es/tree/5893ec6efb7111d7dbc263aeeb75d693426cacdd/packages/protoc-gen-es#import_extensionjs), but it might be hard to find solution that works everywhere. In my setup, I went with the default setting which works OK in the bundler, but it broke my Jest tests. I found a solution in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest/issues/1057) - add a [`moduleNameMapper` to Jest config](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#modulenamemapper-objectstring-string--arraystring) which removes the `.js` extension from imports, i.e. makes the JS imports extension-less and the Jest will use its resolution algorithm to match the file.

   ```json
   // jest.config.json
   {
     "moduleNameMapper": {
       "^(.+)\\.js$": "$1"
     }
   }
   ```

1. The protobuf `oneof` are generated into the TypeScript as union, i.e. the message

   ```protobuf
   message Flip {
     string flap = 1;
     oneof toss {
       bool heads = 2;
       bool tails = 3;
     }
   }
   ```

   is generated as

   ```TypeScript
   export type Flip = { flap?: string } & (
    | { heads?: boolean; }
    | { tails?: boolean; }
   );
   ```

   this captures the mutual exclusivity but is a little cumbersome to work with in TypeScript, because if you attempt to access `flip.heads` the compiler complaints that `heads` might not be defined. This forces you to use [the JavaScript `in` operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/in) which acts as a type guard. It is little inconvenient to use it each time you want to access the `oneof` field, but it is the proper way to tackle this problem.

   ```TypeScript
   let test = flip.heads; // ‚ùå TS error: Object is possibly 'undefined'.
   if ("heads" in flip) {
     test = flip.heads; // ‚úÖ OK, the `heads` is the `oneof` field
     test = flip.tails; // ‚ùå TS error: the `heads` and `tails` are mutually exclusive
   }

   ```

## Development

First, read the [Protobuf-ES: Writing Plugins](https://github.com/bufbuild/protobuf-es/blob/main/docs/writing_plugins.md#protobuf-es-writing-plugins) and familiarize yourself with the [Bun toolkit](https://bun.sh/docs).

Use test-driven development, first write a failing test with feature you want to implement and then change the code.

Folders and their meaning

- `/options/` - when you want to read options (a.k.a. extensions) from the proto files, and the options are non-scalar, such as

  ```proto
  option (google.api.http) = {get: "/v1/{name_test=projects/*/documents/*}:customMethod"};
  ```

  where the value of the `google.api.http` is an object, the protobuf-es framework requires you to have prepared the object types as `@bufbuild/protobuf/Message` JavaScript classes. Jere we are using `buf` to convert all options commonly used in gRPC-gateway into the required messages classes. There is a script `bun run generateOptions` which outputs the JavaScript classes into the `/options/` folder, from which we import the classes during generation.

- `/src/` - the main source code of this plugin

  - `index.ts` - instantiates the plugin with protobuf-es framework
  - `generate.Ts.ts` - the main logic of the plugin,
  - `helpers.ts` - various helpers for the plugin,
  - `runtime.ts` - this file is not used during generation, but contains common code for the runtime - the file is coppied by the plugin into the output folder and other generated files imports common logic from there.

- `/tests/` - the test files, written using [`bun` test API](https://bun.sh/docs/cli/test), you can run the test from CLI with `bun test` in the root of this repo or use bun plugin for your IDE to run and debug the tests selectivelly (highly recommended). There is an e2e setup which abstracts the `protoc` generation. The test framework accepts string representing a proto file, uses `buf` "black-magic" to resolve all proto dependencies and prepares the `CodeGeneratorRequest`[^2], which is then passed to our logic and you can assert the generated TypeScript code.

  The generated code and your asserts are compiled via `tsc` so formatting nuances and comments are stripped away and the syntax of both values is verified before the test. Each test case is selfcontained, you must pass in valid proto file content and you obtain all generated TypeScript files.

- `/tools/go` - the shell script for invoking GO libraries with pinned version.

[^2]: the `protoc` feeds the plugin with gRPC message `CodeGenerationRequest` on stdin and awaits the gRPC `CodeGeneraionResponse` on stdout.

### Development caveats

1. The `bun` is used also as a package manager, use [`bun add`](https://bun.sh/docs/cli/add) for adding dependencies, [`bun run`](https://bun.sh/docs/cli/run) for running NPM scripts or [`bunx`](https://bun.sh/docs/cli/bunx) instead of `npx`.
1. Beware that `bun` and `buf` are two different things and easy to confuse, it is easy to make mistake like running `bun` command with `buf` and vice versa.
1. Because `buf` can only read proto files from the file-system, each test writes a temporary file into `/tests/proto/`. The name of the file passed to `getCodeGeneratorRequest` function in the test is the actual name of the file created in `/tests/proto/` directory, therefor **each test must use unique file name**. I usually name the file loosely after the test-case.
